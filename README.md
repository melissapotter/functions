The purpose of this assignment was to create a hotel app that allows you to book a room based on what type of room you're interested in. There are various room numbers that correlate with the room types, and I've added functions to remove a room number once it has been booked and add it into the booked rooms. I also created a sales report showing how much money the Hotel made based on the number of rooms booked.
